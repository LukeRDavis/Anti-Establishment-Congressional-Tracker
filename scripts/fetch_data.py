Anti-Intervention classification pipeline:
  Democrats/Independents:
    TrackAIPAC /congress "Track AIPAC Approved" → antiArms=True, level=soft
    Congress.gov bill co-sponsorship            → upgrade to hard
    LegiScan Yes vote on anti-intervention bill         → upgrade to hard

  Republicans:
    RLC Liberty Index score ≥ 75               → antiArms=True, level=soft
    Congress.gov bill co-sponsorship            → upgrade to hard
    Congress.gov house-vote No on pro-arms      → upgrade to hard
    KNOWN_ANTI_INTERVENTION override (118th record)     → sets level directly

  Both:
    KNOWN_ANTI_INTERVENTION dict                        → authoritative override

Challengers:
  TrackAIPAC /endorsements                     → anti-intervention D/I challengers
  RLC /endorsements blog posts                 → anti-intervention R challengers

2. Co-sponsored HR 3565 (Block the Bombs Act) or equivalent anti-arms legislation

- Called for arms review or pause (without a vote or bill co-sponsorship)
- Said they are "concerned" about civilian casualties
